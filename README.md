👋 Hi there! I'm Mike, an economist/sociologist with a passion for data analytics. I'm a firm believer in the power of technology to make the world a better place, and I'm particularly interested in using my skills to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

📊 My interests are natural language processing (NLP), geographic information systems (GIS), cartography, system analysis, and data visualizations. I'm skilled in using R and Python (and Excel/VBA), as my primary working languages. I'm also familiar with SQL and basic JavaScript.
